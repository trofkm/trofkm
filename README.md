## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on recently:

### Unreal Engine, VR and Lidar Point Cloud Processing

I've been developing a huge lidar point cloud processing tools with Unreal Engine 5, which is one of my favorite game engines.

I also have been working on VR game with multiplayer using Unreal Engine 5. Now I'm going to develop an interactive drone's camera simulator using Unreal Engine and Cesium.

### Backend Development

I've been working on a backend system using Golang that handles video and telemetry data stream from UAV. I was also involved in a large-scale service-oriented project that handled 500 MB/s of binary traffic and processed it in real time. 

### Drone Development

Previously, I was involved in a UAV project where I developed software for processing high-resolution aerial imagery. Here's a glimpse of the drone in action:

### Vulkan and Computer Graphics

I'm also currently studying Vulkan and computer graphics, and I've been working on a project that involves creating a real-time 3D rendering engine. Recently, I created my own path-tracing renderer :)
